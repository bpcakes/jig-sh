# Codex Execution Plans (ExecPlans)

An ExecPlan is a self-contained, living plan that another engineer or agent can
implement and resume using only the plan and the current worktree. Assume programming
competence but no prior knowledge of this repository or conversation.

## When to Use an ExecPlan

Use an ExecPlan for complex features, significant refactors, uncertain designs, or work
that needs a durable handoff. Small, routine edits do not need one unless requested.
Read this file before authoring or resuming a plan; follow applicable `AGENTS.md`
instructions and repository workflow requirements.

A request to investigate, review, or plan does not authorize implementation. When
implementation is requested, continue through the agreed scope without asking for
permission at each milestone. A plan does not grant additional authority: honor the
user's scope and the harness's permissions and approval rules.

## Required Properties

- Describe the user-visible outcome, scope, constraints, and observable acceptance
  criteria.
- Include the task-specific context, decisions, assumptions, and next actions needed for
  a fresh reader to proceed. Summarize essential external knowledge; links may
  supplement it, not replace it.
- Inspect relevant code and repository instructions before specifying changes.
  Distinguish verified facts from assumptions and proposed paths or interfaces; do not
  invent commands, APIs, or results.
- Specify required behavior, compatibility boundaries, and important interfaces
  precisely. Leave incidental implementation choices open when they do not affect
  acceptance.
- Scale detail to uncertainty and risk. Preserve essential handoff information; omit
  repeated rules, generic tutorials, raw transcripts, and speculative work outside the
  task.

## Execution and Uncertainty

Resolve discoverable questions by inspecting the repository or running focused checks.
For routine, reversible choices within scope, choose a reasonable default and record
material assumptions. Ask a focused question when an unresolved decision materially
affects the outcome or required authorization is missing; continue independent,
authorized work where possible.

Organize implementation into verifiable milestones with dependencies, intended results,
and acceptance checks. When feasibility is uncertain, use a bounded investigation or
prototype with a question, evidence to collect, and a criterion for choosing the next
approach. Revise the plan when evidence changes the approach; do not keep executing
obsolete steps.

When subagents are available, delegate independent work when it is likely to improve
time or quality. Give each assignment a bounded scope, relevant context, allowed write
paths, and expected evidence. Avoid overlapping writes. The main agent integrates and
verifies the result.

## Required Sections

Every ExecPlan must contain these sections and keep them current:

- `Progress`: Checkboxes for completed and remaining work; split partially completed
  items. Include a restart checkpoint: current milestone, next action, blockers, and
  relevant worktree or environment state. Record the associated Jig plan ID and baseline
  when using structured work.
- `Surprises & Discoveries`: Findings that changed the approach, with concise evidence
  or repository-local artifact references. Use "None yet" when appropriate.
- `Decision Log`: Material decisions, their rationale, and significant changes to scope
  or approach. Include dates and identify superseded decisions; do not record a running
  thought transcript.
- `Outcomes & Retrospective`: Delivered behavior compared with acceptance criteria,
  verification evidence, remaining gaps, and lessons. Until completion, state what
  remains unverified or unfinished.

## Writing Rules

Use plain Markdown with descriptive headings. Prefer short paragraphs; use lists and
tables when they clarify steps or comparisons. Define repository-specific and
non-obvious terms. Do not wrap an on-disk plan in an outer code fence.

Name repository-relative paths and relevant symbols. For commands, give the working
directory, prerequisites, exact invocation, and expected result. Clearly label expected
output separately from observed output. Reference existing repository documentation
precisely and include the task-specific explanation needed to use it.

Use the repository's established location for plans and evidence. For Jig-managed work,
connect the narrative to the existing structured-work workflow and receipts rather than
creating a competing gate ledger. Keep secrets out of plans and evidence.

## Suggested Skeleton

Use this order; combine supporting sections when that avoids repetition. Keep the four
required sections distinct. Address each applicable topic below; briefly explain
material omissions.

1. Title and purpose, including scope and acceptance criteria
2. `Progress`
3. `Surprises & Discoveries`
4. `Decision Log`
5. `Outcomes & Retrospective`
6. Context and orientation
7. Plan of work and milestones
8. Concrete steps
9. Validation and acceptance
10. Idempotence and recovery
11. Interfaces and dependencies

## Verification and Recovery

Tie completion to evidence of the requested behavior. Run change-appropriate checks and
all applicable repository-required gates. For bug fixes, include a regression check that
distinguishes the faulty behavior from the fix when practical. Use the relevant
functional, visual, performance, or compatibility checks for the outcome being changed.

Record what actually ran and its result, including failures and checks that were not
run. Explain blockers and remaining verification. Never present an expected result or
stale receipt as current proof. Once acceptance and required checks are satisfied,
finish; additional testing needs a concrete unresolved concern, changed input, or
repository requirement.

For durable-state or compatibility-sensitive changes, specify rollout order,
mixed-version behavior, and recovery. Explain which operations are repeatable and how to
detect partially applied work. Prefer safe retries or forward recovery where rollback
would lose data. Preserve unrelated worktree changes.

## Maintenance Rule

Update affected sections after meaningful progress, discoveries, or changed
requirements, and before a handoff or planned context reset. Keep current instructions
unambiguous while preserving material decision history. On resume, reconcile the
checkpoint with the actual worktree and current evidence before acting. Resume from the
current state; do not blindly replay completed or destructive steps.
